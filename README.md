### What this tool does

1. Migrates standard role directories and a few files into a role within a collection:
    * `defaults`
    * `files`
    * `handlers`
    * `meta`
    * `tasks`
    * `templates`
    * `tests`
    * `vars`
    * `README.md` / `README`
    * `LICENSE.txt` / `LICENSE`
    * For any other file or directory you wish to keep with a role use `--extra-path`
1. Migrates plugins from the role into the collection level plugin directories
1. Rewrites `module_utils` imports in `modules` and `module_utils` to support the migration
1. Migrates all other directories or files into the root of the collection

### Notes

1. Does not perform `doc_fragments` rewrites
1. Does not do anything with the `tests` directory, other than keep them with the role
1. Does not modify anything in role YAML files
1. Overwrites duplicate files
1. Does not come with any warranties
1. Does not special case any 3rd party tool directory or files, use `--extra-path` to support this
